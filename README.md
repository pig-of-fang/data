Example data of wiring error leakage user identification algorithms considering data quality issues
This data is used to support the wiring error leakage subscriber identification algorithm in the presence of interference from data quality issues 
Specifically, it includes 203 subscribers' second-level current data for a one-day time span, including a real part and an imaginary part.
Also included is second-level data of residual current, including a real part and an imaginary part.
